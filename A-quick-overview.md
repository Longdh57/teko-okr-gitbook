# Teko OKR

The OKR methodology is used for agile employee management. By setting objectives, teams and employees are motivated to work more efficiently and creatively. OKR tools visualise the defined goals and show progress.  
Burning OKR starts exactly here and focuses on supporting teams in planning and creating transparency for the company.   
Instead of setting goals classically at departmental level, Burning-OKR allows teams to be put together completely freely. The teams are composed of the roles OKR-Master (alternatively: OKR-Champion), topic sponsor and team members.  
Burning OKR follows the approach that the structure can be set up in any nesting.
